# 🏄 Pug Surf

A small 3D endless surfing game — a pug on a longboard, carving a procedurally
generated ocean. Built with [three.js](https://threejs.org/); no build step, no
dependencies to install.

## Play it

**▶ https://zyrusarmand.github.io/Surf-/**

Published from `main` by the workflow below, on every push.

**Locally:** clone the repo and open `index.html` in any modern browser, or serve
the folder:

```bash
npx http-server -p 8080 .   # then open http://localhost:8080
```

## Controls

| Action | Touch | Keyboard | Mouse |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Carve left / right | swipe left / right | `A` / `D` or `←` / `→` | drag left / right |
| Shift weight (nose / tail) | swipe up / down | `W` / `S` or `↑` / `↓` | drag up / down |
| Jump | JUMP button | `Space` | — |
| Spin | SPIN button | `J` (hold) | — |
| Flip | FLIP button | `K` (hold) | — |
| Grab (in air) / hand drag (on water) | GRAB button | `L` (hold) | — |
| Grab the seaplane's rope | ROPE! button | — | click ROPE! |

Land your rotations square or you'll eat it. Hitting a ramp launches you, jellyfish
bounce you, and buoys, logs and shark fins end the run.

## Files

- `index.html` — the whole game (markup, styles, and logic in one file)
- `vendor/three.min.js` — three.js r128, vendored so the page works offline and
  depends on no third-party host
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` — publishes the repo root to GitHub Pages

## Versions

The running version is shown at the bottom of the screen. Bump `VERSION` in
`index.html` whenever something ships.

- **v1.9.0** — Waves build and fade as they roll in instead of a rigid pattern
  sliding past: every component now carries a travelling envelope, so the sea comes
  in sets with quiet stretches between. Crashes carry real momentum — forward speed
  throws the rider, lateral drift carries across, and a blown trick puts him in the
  water mid-rotation, still turning, rather than snapping upright first. Ramps give
  enough hang time for over two full spins or flips.
- **v1.8.0** — HUD split evenly across the top (score, distance, mph, best). Day now
  begins at sunrise and arcs up before settling into the sunset. Tentacle sweep roughly
  quadrupled so the arms visibly flow. The screen splat is sized from the viewport, so
  it fits within a phone's width instead of swallowing the screen. Speed climbs further
  with distance, every landed trick leaves you carrying extra speed, and leaning is a
  real throttle with a dead zone so carving no longer nudges it.
- **v1.7.0** — A visible sun and a sunset. The day cycle existed but needed ~4300 m
  to reach golden hour, so a normal run never saw it; it now warms within a few
  hundred metres and is a full sunset past a kilometre. The sun is a bright disc with
  a soft radial glow that sinks and reddens as you go. Sky only: the scene lights and
  the ocean's colours are deliberately left untouched, so the water, animals, board
  and pug render exactly as before.
- **v1.6.0** — Octopus reshaped to the reference: a broad round dome instead of an
  upright egg, arms fanning from around its rim with contrasting orange suckers, and
  nine joints per arm. Every arm gets its own splay, coil, length and tip hook, and
  every joint its own pair of rates, phases and amplitudes, so the motion flows,
  never repeats on a loop, and no two octopuses wave in step.
- **v1.5.0** — Distance travelled shown in the HUD and on the wipeout card. Jumping
  onto a jellyfish now bounces reliably — any airborne contact above the bell counts,
  rising or falling, and the contact window widens with speed. A splat can no longer
  stay stuck over the game-over screen.
- **v1.4.0** — The splat is now the real 3D starfish model parented to the camera,
  hanging in front of the lens and drawn over the scene, rather than a flat SVG. It
  squashes on impact, then peels off and slides down the view.
- **v1.3.0** — Fixes steering freezing permanently after iOS cancelled a touch.
  The jellyfish is no longer treated as rock: landing on the bell bounces you,
  a direct hit stings with a lightning flash. The splat that covers your view is
  now drawn to match the starfish that threw it, in that starfish's colour.
- **v1.2.0** — Octopus reworked toward the real animal: one deep purple colourway
  instead of three, papillae on the mantle, amber eyes with horizontal slit pupils,
  and no cartoon face. Arms are much longer and rebuilt as eight-joint chains, so a
  travelling wave runs down each one and they coil and swirl instead of swinging
  rigidly.
- **v1.1.0** — Octopuses replace the giant squid: they float past like any other
  obstacle, turn to track you, and lob starfish. Each one rolls its own accuracy
  between 20% and 90%, so plenty of shots are thrown deliberately wide. Octopus
  and starfish both remodelled (curling suckered arms, plump dotted star with a
  face). Version number now shown on screen.
- **v1.0.0** — First playable release.

## Deployment notes

Pages is already set up (**Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**) and the
site is live. Two things that had to be done by hand, worth knowing if this is
ever rebuilt elsewhere:

- The workflow token cannot create a Pages site, so Pages must be switched on in
  repository settings first — otherwise `configure-pages` fails with
  `Create Pages site failed … Resource not accessible by integration`.
- The `github-pages` environment only allows deployments from the default branch.
  A run triggered on a feature branch is rejected before any step executes, so
  the job fails in seconds with no logs. Deploy from `main`.
